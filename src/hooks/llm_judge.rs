//! LLM-as-Judge hook: semantically evaluates tool calls for intent alignment.
//!
//! Registered as a [`HookPoint::BeforeToolCall`] hook when
//! `SAFETY_LLM_JUDGE_ENABLED=true`. Runs AFTER heuristic safety checks and
//! BEFORE tool execution. Disabled by default — zero overhead when off.
//!
//! On approval-resumed calls the `intent` field is `None` — the hook skips
//! evaluation because the user already explicitly authorised the tool.
